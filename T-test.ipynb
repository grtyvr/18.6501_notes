    "One of the problems with the Wald test is that it depends upon asymptotic relsuts.  As such we can only apply the Wald test when we have enough samples to ensure that we have asymptotic normality.  Recall that we used the Central Limit Theorem, and Slutsky's lemma to give us that our test statistic was at least asymptoticaly normal. So what if we were to just assume that the data we have for our test statistic is already derived from a normal distribution?  That get's us part way there.  At least we have removed the dependence on the Central Limit Theorem.  Next we need to remove the dependence on Slutsky's lemma.  How can we go about this?  We consider an example.\n",

Suppose that the average wind speed needs to be 10 mph to make it practical.  Thus we have $X_1,\\dots,X_12 \\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim}\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.

We are simply removing the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.  But this is not all we need.  The standard deviation is not know at this point and we will have to estimate it.

    "\n",
    "So the T-test gives us an exact test in the sense that we know the distribution of the test statistic so it gives us non-asyptotic p-values.  Why would we want to use the Wald test?  There are two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The Wald test is more specific.  It will reject the null hypothesis in cases where the T statistic is close to the boundary of the rejection region for the T test.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this when you [compare the tails of a normal distribution to the tails of the T distribution.](#t-widget)  The tails of the T distribution are above the tails of the normal distribution.  If we denote the quantiles of the standard Gaussian as $q_\\alpha$ and the quantiles of the T-distribution as $q^{t_{k}}_\\alpha$, then $q^{t_{k}}_\\alpha \\lt q_\\alpha$ if we are out in the tails of the distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The Wald test is more general in the sense that it can be used with any estimator you like, not just an estimator of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The T-test was designed to test the mean of a distribution only.  You can not use it as a test of the variance or of any other parameter of a distribution that is not the mean (like $\\lambda$ in an exponential distribution).\n",

    "## Two Sample T-tests and the Welch-Satterthwaite Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our example of a clinical trial.  We have a two sample test where we are looking to determine if a drug has a positive effect on lowering LDL cholesterol.  We had two groups, a control and a test group.  We denote the expected decrease in LDL cholesterol as $\\mu_d$ for the test group, the group that received the drug, and $\\mu_c$ the expected decrease in the control group, the group that received a placebo.  Both of these were assumed to be positive since the placebo effect is a real phenomena.  We set up the null hypothesis as the drug is no more effective than the placebo and the alternative hypothesis is that the drug is more effective than the placebo.\n",

We would just find a consistent estimator for $\\sigma^2_d$ say $\\hat{\\sigma}^2_d$ and similarly for the control and use those in place of $\\sigma^2_d$ and $\\sigma^2_c$ and use asymptotic results.  But what happens when we don't have enough samples?  Can we use the T-test machinery in this case?\n",
